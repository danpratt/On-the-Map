## Description

This is an app that allows users to login using their Udacity credentials, and then contribute a location and url that is shared with all other Udacity iOS Nanodegree students.

## Purpose

This was an assignment for my iOS degree course at Udacity.  The purpose of this app was to learn how to use web API's by making GET, POST, DELETE, etc. requests, and parsing JSON results.  It also allowed me to become familiar with MapKit.

## Contributing

This app is specific to Udacity's Nanodegree course, and doesn't require contributions.  For non-Udacity students who are learning about using web API's, and JSON parsing, feel free to poke through the code.
